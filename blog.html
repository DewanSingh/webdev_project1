    <h1>Dewan's video game blog</h1>
    <p>My main hobbies are watching anime/tv shows and playing video games. Right now, some of my favorite tv shows are Castlevania and One Punch Man. I play way more video games than watching shows so I wanted to focus on just making this a video game blog. My two favorite games right now are Monster Hunter Rise and Hades. I put at least 100+ hours into each of these games. For Monster Hunter Rise, I played it on Nintendo Switch and PC so I probably put 200+ hours in it lol. Here you're going to here what I liked about these games and some things that could be better. SPOILERS are ahead.</p>

    <h3>Monster Hunter Rise</h3>

    <p>I have been a long time fan of the Monster Hunter series. I have been playing since Monster Hunter 4 which came out in 2015. The majority of each new installment really improved on the previous titles, except Monster Hunter World. While I really like Monster Hunter World (I put 300+ hours into this game), the combat felt way more weak and each weapon felt like it was missing something. Most of the other games had a gimmick like sub-species, hunter arts, hunting styles or event monsters. What Monster Hunter World did very well is that they streamlined many of the annoying and convoluted game systems which took out a lot of the frustration that other games have caused me.</p>
    <p>What makes me really like Monster Hunter Rise is that it massively improved upon the movement, the companion customization and weapon versatility. The movement was greatly improved because they introduced a ninja-like mechanic in the game called wire-bugs where you can use these bugs to preform high jumps, scaling high walls, dodge attacks or even use wire-bug skills in combat. This feature added so much to the game because it increased the verticality of every fight. In every other game, if you wanted to jump or scale a wall, you would have to find a cliff to jump off of (no fall damage lol) or find a specific spot to climb up. But now, you can even use wire-bugs to dodge or defend attacks making the really slow weapons viable with fighting more monsters.</p>
