    <h1>Dewan's video game blog</h1>
    <p>My main hobbies are watching anime/tv shows and playing video games. Right now, some of my favorite tv shows are Castlevania and One Punch Man. I play way more video games than watching shows so I wanted to focus on just making this a video game blog. My two favorite games right now are Monster Hunter Rise and Hades. I put at least 100+ hours into each of these games. For Monster Hunter Rise, I played it on Nintendo Switch and PC so I probably put 200+ hours in it lol. Here you're going to here what I liked about these games and some things that could be better. SPOILERS are ahead.</p>
